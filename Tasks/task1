# Building an iOS App using Python

## Task Description

In this task, you will learn how to build an iOS app using Python. While Python is not a native iOS development language, we can utilize a tool called KIVY to help us achieve this. KIVY is an open-source library that enables the creation of cross-platform apps using Python.

## Task Objectives

1. Understand the basics of KIVY framework.
2. Set up a development environment for building iOS apps with Python.
3. Create a simple iOS app using Python and KIVY.

## Resources

- [KIVY Documentation](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/)

## Steps

### Step 1: Understanding KIVY

Before diving into building the iOS app, familiarize yourself with the KIVY framework. Read through the official documentation to grasp the core concepts.

### Step 2: Setting Up Development Environment

Follow the instructions provided in the KIVY documentation to set up your development environment for iOS app development with Python.

### Step 3: Creating a Simple iOS App

Using the knowledge gained from Step 1 and Step 2, create a basic iOS app using Python and KIVY. You can start with a "Hello World" application to get comfortable with the process.

## Submission Guidelines

Please submit your code via a pull request to this repository. Ensure that your code is well-documented and organized. Include a README file with instructions on how to run the app.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Understanding of KIVY framework
- Correct setup of the development environment
- Functionality and design of the iOS app
- Code quality and organization

## Additional Notes

- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any difficulties during the process.

Happy coding!
