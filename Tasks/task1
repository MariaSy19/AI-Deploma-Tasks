# Building an iOS App using Python

## Task Description

In this task, you will embark on a journey to build an iOS app using Python. Although Python isn't native to iOS development, we'll leverage the powerful [Kivy framework](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/) to bridge this gap. Kivy is an open-source library that empowers developers to create cross-platform apps using Python.

## Task Objectives

1. **Understand the Basics of Kivy Framework.**
2. **Set Up a Development Environment for iOS Apps with Python.**
3. **Create a Simple iOS App Using Python and Kivy.**

## Resources

- [Kivy Documentation](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/)

## Answer:

To build an iOS app using Python, you can utilize the Kivy framework. Kivy is an open-source Python library that enables the creation of cross-platform mobile applications, including those for iOS. Keep in mind that Python is not a native iOS development language, so Kivy acts as a bridge to facilitate this process.
