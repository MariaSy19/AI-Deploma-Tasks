''' What the types of parser in BeautifulSoup ?
## Types of Parsers:
1- html.parser:
 is a built-in HTML parser that comes with Python. It is a tool that helps
 you extract information from HTML code. Think of HTML as the language 
 websites use to structure and present information.
#######################
2- lxml:
is another HTML and XML parser, but it's different from the built-in 
html.parser in Python. It's a more powerful and faster external 
library that you can use to parse and manipulate HTML and XML documents.
#######################
3- html5lib:
 is another HTML parser that you can use with BeautifulSoup in Python.
 Just like html.parser, it helps you understand and extract information
 from HTML code, but it follows the HTML5 specification more closely.
