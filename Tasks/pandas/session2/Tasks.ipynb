    "- A lambda expression in Python is a concise way to create anonymous functions. It is often used for short, simple operations that can be defined in a single line. The syntax for a lambda function is: '' lambda arguments: expression ''\n",
    "example:\n",
    "square = lambda x: x ** 2\n"

    "1. Data Structure:\n",
    "RDBMS: Structured data in tables with predefined schema.\n",
    "NoSQL: Varied data models (e.g., key-value pairs, documents) without rigid schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "    RDBMS: Requires a fixed schema defined before data insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    NoSQL: Supports dynamic or schema-less data insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "   RDBMS: Primarily scales vertically (increasing server power).\n",
    "\n",
    "   NoSQL: Scales horizontally by adding more servers for distributed processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "   RDBMS: Mainly uses SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "   NoSQL: May have various query languages or APIs, sometimes less sophisticated than SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "   RDBMS: Complex relationships, data integrity; common in traditional business applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "   NoSQL: Rapidly changing data, large-scale distributed systems, flexibility in data models; common in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Consistency and Transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   RDBMS: Emphasizes ACID properties for transaction consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "   NoSQL: Prioritizes factors like availability and partition tolerance, may relax consistency in certain scenarios."
